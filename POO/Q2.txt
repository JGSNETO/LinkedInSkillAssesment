Q: For which case would the use of a static attribute be appropriate?
R: the weather conditions for each house in a small neighborhood
T: Static Attributes
E: When you want to have a variable that always has the same value for every object of the class, 
forever and ever, make it static. A (simplified) way to think of it is that a non-static member 
(field, method) is one which is provided by an instance, while a static member is one which 
is provided by a class.
