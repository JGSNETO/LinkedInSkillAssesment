Q: What is an example of dynamic binding?
R: Method overriding
T: Method overriding
E: Static Binding or Early Binding in Java refers to a process where the compiler determines 
the type of object and resolves the method during the compile-time. 
Generally, the compiler binds the overloaded methods using static binding.
When the compiler resolves the method call binding during the execution of the program, 
such a process is known as Dynamic or Late Binding in Java. 
We also call Dynamic binding as Late Binding because binding takes place during 
the actual execution of the program.
